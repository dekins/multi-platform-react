# multi-platform-react
Sharing of React code across Web, iOS, Android, Electron as Hello World example

## FOLDER STRUCTURE

### React Native init

Repo was created using `react-native init MultiPlatformReact` which initially
created a folder named the same in the root project. In addition, this uses
eslint so there was an addition `npm install --save-dev eslint-plugin-react`
command run. The initial structure looked like:

### Moving things around

To make the project a little easier to navigate (I hope), the files now reside
like the following:
